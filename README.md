# Plant-o-matic

This is the prototype of a Smart Green house that is self-sustainable and utilises renewable energy. An IoT based model is followed, minimal human intervention is needed to manage the greenhouse. Various sensors are placed in the greenhouse to collect data crucial to plant growth such as moisture levels, oxygen and carbon-di-oxide levels and regulate their presence.

The 3D model of the greenhouse is shown here, it has solar panels to power it using renewable sources of energy and a rain water harvesting system attached.
